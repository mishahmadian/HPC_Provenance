# (parallel): defines the number of process that can be run concurrently for collecting
# File Operations per user per job per MDT. The best practice is to set
#       parallel = # of MDT targets
# But it depend how many cores need to be occupied at the same time.
# (parallel = {n < 1}  --> meant all the CPU cores will be used)

# (user): comma separated list of lustre user name(s) that Lustre Changelog has been registered with. Example:

#   mds# lctl --device lustre-MDT0000 changelog_register  --> register ChangeLog user on mds for lustre-MDT0000
#   mds# lctl get_param lustre-MDT0000.changelog_users    --> find the registered user fo lustre-MDT0000 on mds

#  Make sure the user names are in the same order of their MDT targets defined under [lustre]->mdt_targets
